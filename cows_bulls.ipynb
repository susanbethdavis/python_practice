    "# Cows and Bulls\n",
    "Create a program to play the game \"cows and bulls.\" This is how the game works. Randomly generate a 4-digit number in the range 0000 to 9999. Ask the user to guess the target number. For every digit the user guesses correctly, they receive a cow. The same digit only ever is counted as one cow, even if it is used multiple times in the value. For every position the user guesses correctly, they receive a bull. Count how many guesses it takes for them to guess the target number."
