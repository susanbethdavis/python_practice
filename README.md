Welcome to my collection of Python coding problems! This repository contains various interactive games that I've developed to sharpen my Python skills. Each project offers a unique challenge, perfect for practice and learning.

1. Cows and Bulls: A number-guessing game where the goal is to correctly guess a randomly generated 4-digit number. Here's how the game works:
  
  - The computer randomly generates a 4-digit number in the range of 0000 to 9999.
  - The player is prompted to guess the target number.
  - For each digit the player guesses correctly (matching both digit and position), they receive a bull.
  - For each correct digit in the wrong position, they receive a cow.
  - A digit is counted as a cow only once, even if it appears multiple times in the target number.
  - The game continues until the player guesses the correct number.
  - The game tracks the number of guesses it takes for the player to guess the target number.
  - This game is a fun way to test your logical thinking and pattern recognition skills.
